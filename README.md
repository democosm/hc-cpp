HC â€” Host Control
==================

## About

We want to help embedded system designers succeed, so we've created some very powerful source code to help. It's called Host Control (HC). It's easy to understand, easy to use, and doesn't require you to pollute your code with ours.

- HC provides a simple way to locally control your application from a console
- HC provides a simple way to remotely control your application
- HC protcol allows chaining multiple applications together

## Download

Pre-built binaries aren't currently created. The source can be downloaded from here: [Releases](https://github.com/democosm/hc-cpp).

## Implemented Features

* Many basic types, such as uint8, uint32, string and double
* Console interface to application
* Property tree discovery

## How to Build

Note: paths could change depending on cloned repo directory, architecture and OS.

```bash
# To build and execute the example server with all basic types
Open a terminal
cd hc-cpp
source activate
cd src/app/scratchsrv
mkposd
../../../dst/x86_64posixdbg/bin/scratchsrv

# To build and execute the example peer to peer message server
Open a terminal
cd hc-cpp
source activate
cd src/app/msgsrv
mkposd
../../../dst/x86_64posixdbg/bin/msgsrv 1501

# To build and execute the HC client
Open a terminal
cd hc-cpp
source activate
cd src/app/hccli
mkposd
../../../dst/x86_64posixdbg/bin/hccli scratchudp.xml
../../../dst/x86_64posixdbg/bin/hccli scratchmsg.xml
../../../dst/x86_64posixdbg/bin/hccli proxy.xml
```


## Libraries for HC

Before you can build, you will need to install the openssl libs and headers.

To download the openssl development package, use ```sudo apt-get install libssl-dev``` or ```sudo apt-get install openssl-dev```.
